    <p class="paragraph">
        Since the start of 2022, I have been working as a perception member of the UAV Forge team. Every year, our team
        competes in the AUVSI aerial vehicle competition in which we work to design, manufacture, and program an
        autonomous UAV that uses machine learning to detect and classify payload dropzone identifiers and release
        special payloads into the dropzone areas. </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The perception team is responsible for enabling our systems to detect, classify, and track payload dropzone
        identifiers from the sky. Each year, we develop machine learning neural networks and advanced vision processes
        that allow us to distinguish one dropzone from another by their colored shape and letter identifiers.

        <h1>Letter Detection</h1>
        <img src="masking.png" alt="Image Masking" class="photo">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In 2023, I built the convolutional neural network (CNN) that our drone used to identify the letter belonging to
        each shape we detect. Once our drone detects a potential dropzone, our drone captures a snapshot of the area,
        running it through a sequence of contours and thresholding to create a black and white mask of what it believes
        the shape and letter pixels are.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The model processes the masked image as input and generates potential probabilities for each letter. In order to
        do this, the neural network uses three convolutional layers, max-pooling for downsampling, followed by several
        dense layers and finally a softmax output layer. This model architecture provided the highest accuracy during
        testing without increasing its runtime to beyond what the drone's onboard computer could handle. </p>

        <h1>Color Classifier</h1>
        <img src="quantization.png" alt="Image Quantization" class="photo">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        My junior year, I took over the development of our new color classifier. In the past, the drone relied on a
        nearest neighbor predictor to guess the color of the shape and letter. This method was not very effective, as
        different lighting conditions would have a dramatic effect on the accuracy of the model, and quantization could
        lead it to lose the color of the letter altogether.
    </p>
    <div class="centered">
        <img src="color-predict.png" alt="Color Model" class="photo">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        I began developing a new CNN to replace the KNN model and hopefully get us higher accuracy. The new CNN takes in
        the raw image of the target, and outputs both the shape color and letter color. I accomplished this by branching
        the neural network into two paths after the feature detection step. The old model was able to achieve 15-20%
        accuracy for shape and letter prediction, this new CNN was achieving a 50% accuracy for both the shape and
        letter predictions. While this model is still being developed, it currently uses 3 convolutional layers with max
        pooling, and then splits into two models with 3 dense and dropout layers.
