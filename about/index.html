                            My name is Michael Krinsky. I am currently a fourth year undergraduate
                            student studying at the University of California, Irvine for a degree in
                            computer science. I am a two-time SpaceX Software Engineering intern,
                            and am currently working as the Chief Engineer for the UCI Rocket
                            Project attempting to break the undergraduate launch record for methalox
                            powered rockets.

                        My freshman year of high school, I joined the two-time world champion FIRST
                        Robotics team at my high school where I gained extensive knowledge in
                        mechanical design, manufacturing, and programming, and I eventually
                        progressed to the role of Design Team Lead in my junior year. Despite the
                        COVID pandemic disrupting our competition season, I am proud to say that our
                        team qualified for the World Championships every year, even ranking number
                        one in our division at Worlds in 2020.

                        developing my skills as a web developer. I developed a banking application
                        and a grocery application using Angular and Spring Boot, gaining valuable
                        experience in full-stack development. When I came to the University of
                        California, Irvine, I continued to expand my web development skills when I
                        took up the position of web developer for UCI's Student Center and Event
                        Services.

                        defining, developing and presenting on the web applications and services
                        that I created over the summer. These projects ranged from developing Flask

                        building data pathways for a high fidelity satellite simulation. Concluding
                        this experience, I presented my work to other departments and leaders at the

                        methalox rocket. I spent my first year on the team as an avionics member,
                        where I wroted the embedded software we used to launch our first ever rocket
                        to 9300 feet in the Spring of 2023. After the launch, we began working on a

                        methalox rockets, and I became the Lead Avionics Engineer for the team.

                        Within the production software team, I developed an automated network

                        where I created the machine learning pipeline for detecting drones using
