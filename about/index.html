                            My name is Michael Krinsky. I am currently an undergraduate student studying at the University of California, Irvine for a degree in computer science. I have experience working at the Aerospace Corporation as a member of their cloud platforms and architectures department, and am currently working as the Lead Avionics Engineer for the UCI Rocket Project attempting to break the undergraduate launch record for methalox powered rockets.

                        My freshman year, I joined my high school's FIRST Robotics competition team, where I gained extensive knowledge in mechanical design, manufacturing, and programming, and I eventually progressed to the role of Design Team Lead in my junior year. Despite the COVID pandemic disrupting our competition season, I am proud to say that our team qualified for the World Championships every year, even ranking number one in our division at Worlds in 2020.

                        During the pandemic, I began working on my own personal projects and developing my skills as a web developer. I developed a banking application and a grocery application using Angular and Spring Boot, gaining valuable experience in full-stack development.  When I came to the University of California, Irvine, I continued to expand my web development skills when I took up the position of web developer for UCI's Student Center and Event Services.

                        The next summer, I was given the opportunity to work as a Software Engineering Intern for the Aerospace Corporation, where I was tasked with defining, developing and presenting on the web applications and services that I created over the summer. These projects ranged from developing Flask web services to monitor critical data metrics for the AeroTel telescope to building data pathways for a high fidelity satellite simulation. Concluding this experience, I presented my work to other departments and leaders at the facility in El Segundo, California.

                        In my sophomore year, I joined the UCI Rocket Project, where I worked tirelessly alongside the team of forty students towards the launch of UCI's first methalox rocket. In the spring of 2023, we accomplished our goal and launched the Preliminary Test Rocket (PTR) to 9300 feet. With UCI's first successful rocket launch complete and a new rocket in development, I stepped up to become our next Lead Avionics Engineer after just 6 months on the team. We are now competing in the FAR-Mars launch contest, working to break the undergraduate launch record for methalox rockets.
