                    I wanted to create an app that would help people stay safe during the COVID-19 crisis. So, I decided on a centralized online application to store grocery items. This way, several families could share grocery lists to hopefully limit the amount of people that needed to go to the store. The grocery app is optimized to fit perfectly on an Iphone screen so it is easy to use while in a store.

			While designing the app, I realized how helpful this app could be in protecting people from COVID-19. My family and I began sharing a grocery list with a high risk elderly woman. By using the grocery app, we were able to combine grocery lists so we could also retrieve her items. Afterwards, we would drop off her groceries at her house.

			 The grocery list has a search bar to look for specific items. It can also be sorted by store or name to easily navigate the grocery list.
