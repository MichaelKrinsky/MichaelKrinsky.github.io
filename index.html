                            Since the beginning of my sophomore year at UCI, I have been an avionics engineer for UCI's collegiate rocket project with the goal of breaking the undergraduate launch record for a methalox powered rocket. By Spring of 2023, we successfully launched our first ever rocket, PTR(Preliminary Test Rocket), to an altitude of 9300 feet, and I have since become the team's Lead Avionics Engineer for the next liquid rocket.

                            The Grocery App is an online grocery list you can use to easily keep track of items you need to buy at the store. Developed during the Coronavirus pandemic, the app allows several families or neighbors to share a list so they can shop for each other at the grocery store. I built it using Angular and Java Web Services.
