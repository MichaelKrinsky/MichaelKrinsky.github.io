                            Since the start of Spring 2024, I've been the chief engineer for the UCI Rocket project. Leading a team of 40 dedicated students, our mission is to break the undergraduate launch record for methalox rockets. Joining the team during my sophomore year, I have worked on a multitude of avionics tasks. Most notably, I developed the avionics system used in launching UCI's first ever liquid rocket where we achieved an altitude of 9300 feet.                        </td>

I built it using Angular and Java Web Services.
