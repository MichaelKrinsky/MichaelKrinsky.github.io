                The UCI Rocket project is a team of undergraduate students that is working to break
                the undergraduate launch record for methalox rockets. After joining the team my
                sophomore year and successfully launching UCI's first ever methalox rocket, I have
                since become the Chief Engineer for the team.

            UCI's first ever liquid rocket took us six years to launch, and now I am leading our
            team to create our next rocket in just two. Since our first launch in Spring of 2023,
            our team has been designing and testing our next rocket, which we plan to have ready by
            the Spring of 2025.

            Along with my responsibilities of being Chief Engineer, I am also the lead developer

            and control the rocket on the pad and during its flight. The React app is also
            responsible for running analyses on the data we gather during our tests.

            Before I became Chief Engineer, I was the Lead Avionics Engineer for the avionics team.

            The Engine Control Unit(ECU) was designed to be the brain of our rocket. It used a
            Teensy microcontroller running Arduino(C++) to control valve states and gather
            temperature and pressure readings on the rocket. I developed the code the ECU used to
            interpret signals from our ground station and translate them into actuating valves on
            our rocket.

            The Avionics Flight System(AFS) is responsible for radio communication during flight and
            transmitting telemetry data to the ground station. I developed software AFS used to
            integrate with the ECU and retrieve solenoid valve states, tank pressures, and tank
            temperatures using I2C.

            I also developed our CLI to allow us to test the rocket without setting up our ground
            station equipment. The CLI is written in python and uses an internet router connected to
            the rocket and an open wifi network to allow any laptop to connect to the rocket over
            wifi. This way, we could actuate valves on the rocket without the need for the switch
            box.
