        The UCI Rocket project is a team of undergraduate students that is
        working to break the undergraduate launch record for methalox rockets.
        After joining the team my sophomore year and successfully launching
        UCI's first ever methalox rocket, I have become the Chief Engineer for
        the team.

    <p class="paragraph">
      Before I became Chief Engineer, I was the Lead Avionics Engineer for the
      avionics team. The avionics team is responsible for researching,
      developing, and testing the electronic systems and software needed to
      launch and recover the rocket.

    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      After launch, our team immediately began researching and developing our
      next methalox rocket, MOCH4. Since then, I have been creating our new
      ground station and control center utilizing web-based technology. The
      control station uses a React frontend and Flask web service to monitor and
      control the state of the rocket, as well as run analysis on data we gather
      during our tests.

      <h1>Engine Control Unit</h1>
      <img src="ECU.jpg" alt="Engine Control Unit" class="photo" />
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The Engine Control Unit(ECU) was designed to be the brain of our rocket.
      It used a Teensy microcontroller running Arduino(C++) to control valve
      states and gather temperature and pressure readings on the rocket. I
      developed the code the ECU used to interpret signals from our ground
      station and translate them into actuating valves on our rocket.

      <img src="telemetry.png" alt="telemetry" class="photo" />
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The Avionics Flight System(AFS) is responsible for radio communication
      during flight and transmitting telemetry data to the ground station. I
      developed software AFS used to integrate with the ECU and retrieve
      solenoid valve states, tank pressures, and tank temperatures using I2C.

      <h1>CLI</h1>
      <img src="cli.png" alt="CLI example" class="photo" />
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I also developed our CLI to allow us to test the rocket without setting up
      our ground station equipment. The CLI is written in python and uses an
      internet router connected to the rocket and an open wifi network to allow
      any laptop to connect to the rocket over wifi. This way, we could actuate
      valves on the rocket without the need for the switch box.
