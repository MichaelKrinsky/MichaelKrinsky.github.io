            As Chief Engineer, I led efforts to prepare our rocket for its static fire testing
            campaign. To reach our target altitude of 25,000 feet, we first needed to validate that
            the engine and feed system could generate enough thrust and sustain a long enough burn.
            In the weeks leading up to our first static fire, we performed ten cold flow tests,
            continuously refining the feed system to maximize our chances of success. Drawing on the
            experience I gained from developing our previous rocket, I played a key role in
            identifying and resolving feed system issues, as well as developing new test procedures
            to verify the system’s performance and reliability.

            Our failure analysis revealed that the G10 fiberglass used as our ablative material was

            that the inner layer of the G10 had delaminated and become lodged in the nozzle,
            disrupting combustion and causing the engine to fail. In preparation for the next static
            fire, we replaced the G10 with a canvas phenolic ablative, which offers more consistent
            and reliable ablation. We also upgraded our injector design to reduce thermal loading on
            the chamber walls, minimizing the ablative’s burden in case of excessively high

            Our failure analysis pointed to vapor-liquid oscillations within the injector, caused by
            the distance between the main valves and the combustion chamber. This distance created a
            section of pipes that was exposed to ambient heat which caused partial vaporization of
            the propellant when the valves opened, creating unsteady flow. This caused the engine to
            extinguish and relight, generating a shockwave that destroyed the nozzle and caused a
            leak in the injector. The melted injector was a symptom of this leak, as it compromised
            the regenerative cooling of the faceplate, resulting in overheating and melting. To fix
            this, we relocated the main valves directly next to the injector and redesigned the
            injector to more evenly spread our propellant orifices across the faceplate for more
            effective cooling.

            Failure analysis revealed significant backflow through the LOX injector holes, causing
            them to expand and rupture the LOX manifold. The root cause appeared to be either
            insufficient back pressure from our feed system or the injector design itself allowing
            propellants to ignite too close to the injector face and heat it to the point of
            failure. To address these issues, we are developing two new injectors: a
            showerhead-style injector to serve as a control to confirm our feed system can generate
            sufficient backpressure, and a redesigned triplet-impinging injector, using copper for
            better cooling and a steeper impingement angle to move the combustion zone further from
            the injector plate. Both will be tested at our next static fire during the Fall of 2025.
