                            I wanted to create an app that would help people stay safe during the COVID-19 crisis. The Grocery App helps people protect those high at risk by providing easy access to an online grocery list that is sharable between families.

                                While designing the app, I realized how helpful this could be in protecting people from COVID-19. With the app, my family could share our grocery list with an elderly woman who couldn't risk visiting the stores herself. By using the grocery app, we were able to retrieve her items when we went to the store and help her stay safe.

                    The grocery list has a search bar to look for specific items. It can also be sorted by store or name. These features are extremely helpful in navigating the grocery list, especially when you are collecting items for many people or families.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The grocery list is protected by a standard username and password system that uses tokens to verify and remember who is logged in. By storing tokens in your device's local storage, you won't have to log in every time you want to use the app. The Grocery App differentiates separate lists using table ID's which specify who has access to certain grocery lists. This allows the Grocery App to handle several different lists at one time.
