### Grocery App

The Grocery App was an app I designed during the COVID-19 quarantine for the purpose of limiting the amount of people who needed to go pick up groceries. With the Grocery app, several families could share a grocery list and reduce the risk of spreading the disease by requiring fewer visits to the store.
