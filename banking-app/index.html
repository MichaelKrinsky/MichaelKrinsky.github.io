                                The Banking Analysis App is a web application I designed to analyze bank statements and separate each individual transaction into different categories. While there currently exist many different apps that automatically sort transactions into pre-determined categories, these categories are not modifiable by the people that use them. I created the Banking Analysis app to allow easy management of transactions into your own personalized categories.

                    The "Your Categories" page displays all of your personal categories and how they proportionally make up your grand total. This can be useful to determine what you are spending the majority of your money on. While the list does nothing to stop you from continuing to spend your money in these places, the shame brought on by a chart nearly filled with categories like "video games" and "entertainment" is a great motivator to change your habits. You can also view what transactions make up each individual category by selecting the category you wish to inspect.

                    The "Transaction List" page divides your bank statement into individual transactions and sorts them in this list. The list can be sorted by category, name, or date.

                    Within the "Sort Transactions" you are able to create your own categories and sort all of your transactions. When You use the buttons to assign a category to the transaction that is currently being displayed, the Banking Analysis App will search through all other transactions to find ones that are similar to it and assign them for you.
