                                The Banking Analysis App is a web application I designed to analyze a bank statement and separate each individual transaction into different categories. While there currently exist many different apps that automatically sort transactions into pre-determined categories, these categories are not modifiable by the people that use them. I created the Banking Analysis app to allow easy management of transactions into your own personalized categories.

                    The grocery list is protected by a standard username and password system that uses tokens to verify and remember who is logged in. By storing tokens in your device's local storage, you won't have to log in every time you want to use the app. The Grocery App differentiates separate lists using table ID's which specify who has access to certain grocery lists. This allows the Grocery App to handle several different lists at one time.
